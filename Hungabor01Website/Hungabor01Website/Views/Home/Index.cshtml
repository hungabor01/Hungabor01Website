    Welcome on my website!

        <p>I am Gábor Gróf, a hungarian .Net developer. I own, maintain and develop this site.</p>

        <p>I have created this website for multiple reasons.</p>

        <p>
            First, I have collected here some of my commonly used projects and features as references for my work. These are presented as articles with full source code and brief description.
            My goal is not to teach these techniques, but to explain the idea and the motivation what and why they are implemented as they are. 
            So you can think of this section like my job portfolio.
        <p />

        <p>
            Secondly, this website is also a reference itself, since it is developed in ASP.Net Core MVC. Therefore, it works like a practice site for me as well.
        </p>

        <p>
            And lastly, the website contains some functionalities just for me. These are hidden behind registration, but accessible for anyone with login.
            These features are used in my everyday life, like money management or my collected learning materials. If you think they can be useful for you as well, feel free to use them.

                    I am a self-taught programmer, who learnt almost everything from the internet and with practice.
                    I have collected the path that I walked through since the beginning and tried to structure these training materials into a big tutorial.
